## **4\. Bounty and Reward Program**

Updates will take effect upon publication on the official Argentum website or repository.  
Existing bounties will be honored under the terms active at their announcement.

## **7\. Legal Status**

Participation in the Argentum Contribution or Bounty Program **does not create any employment, partnership, or agency relationship** between the Contributor and the Licensor.  
All participation is voluntary, at-will, and governed by the Argentum Software License.
